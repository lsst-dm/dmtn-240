\begin{abstract}
This paper covers some astronomy design patterns and perhaps some anti-patterns in astronomy. We will use our experience on several long projects such as Rubin Observatory, Gaia, SDSS,  UKIRT and JCMT to highlight some of the the things which worked and a few things that did not work so well.

\section{Introduction}

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time \citep{2019ApJ...873..111I} is "deep fast wide" optical/near-IR survey of half the sky in ugrizy bands to r 27.5 (36 nJy) based on 825 visits over a 10-year period.
Carried out by Rubin Observatory on Cerro Pach\'{o}n Chile, the survey will produce around 100\,PB of data consisting of about a billion 16\,Mpix images, enabling measurements for 40 billion objects!
